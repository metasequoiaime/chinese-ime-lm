"""Build a character-level training corpus for the candidate-reranking model.

Two sources, both redistributable:

- Chinese Wikipedia article dumps (CC BY-SA 4.0) — written prose, supplies the vocabulary and the register the IME meets when someone is composing a sentence.
- LCCC (MIT) — open-domain dialogue, supplies the colloquial register that Wikipedia has almost none of.
- Chinese technical documentation (CC BY 4.0, CC BY-SA 2.5, Apache-2.0) — the register someone writes in while working, which neither of the other two contains at all.
- The Chinese portion of C4 (ODC-BY) — web text, the register people type in, and the only source here that reaches the scale a language model needs.

Output is one normalized sentence per line, UTF-8. Everything outside the kept character set is a segmentation boundary rather than a substitution, because the model only ever scores runs of Chinese characters: at inference the candidates handed to it come from the pinyin decoder and contain nothing else.
